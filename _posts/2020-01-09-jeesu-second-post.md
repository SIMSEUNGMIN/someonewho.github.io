It's really hard to build project.  
Especially, Design the project.  
Thanks to the Software Engineering class, I make a blueprint step by step.  
  
We are not farmillar with GUN THING.  
So, we study about the actions in gun when it is firing.  
It is quite scary, but little bit funny.  
  
**My Milestone is This.**  
  
1. Make a detector and the dashboard webpage for data (~Jan 14)  
2. Add Analysys page (~Jan 17)  
3. do Analyzation with ML (~Feb 15)  

I know that is quite tight schedule, but I believe it will keep me from being lazy.
