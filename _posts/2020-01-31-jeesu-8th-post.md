our problem is incomplete combusion because of gas leaking. Especially Oxygen.  

our project needs sensor circuit. and It needs to be solved following three things.
1. the heat: when gun fires continuously, it goes really hot. ~3,400'C.  
2. the rebound: the power of firing is strong. it comes to react.  
3. the pressure: when gun fires, the barrel is goes really high pressure.  
    
***the 1st prototype***  
<img src="/pictures/proto01.png" width="450px" height="300px" title="prototype ver.1"></img><br/>  
using propane, oxygen, pressure sensors  
using raspberry pi, arduino  
  
problem is...  
wrong position of oxygen, propane sensors  
barrel must not be damaged  
  
***the 2nd prototype***  
<img src="/pictures/proto02.png" width="450px" height="300px" title="prototype ver.2"></img><br/>    
adding the extra barrel  
attach oxygen, propane sensors to the end of the barrel  
  
problem is...  
making extra barrel takes too long time  
Risk of pressure sensor in the barrel because of the heat & the pressure  

***the 3rd prototype***  
<img src="/pictures/proto03.png" width="450px" height="300px" title="prototype ver.3"></img><br/>    
removing pressure sensor inside the barrel  
attaching oxygen, propane sensors to the muzzle of the gun  
  
problem is...  
oxygen sensor's respond time is too slow(~15 sec)  
and we can't control respond  
  
***the 4th prototype***  
<img src="/pictures/proto04.png" width="450px" height="300px" title="prototype ver.4"></img><br/>    
replacing oxygen sensor to propane sensor  
  
problem is...  
fiberglass tape doesn't work to prevent heat  
attaching cooler on the barrel is very dangerous
  
***the 5th prototype***  
We are preparing now with 3D printer  
  
***current situation & next month plan***  
****current situation****  
building the prototype  
checking and calibrate sensors  
making the dashboard for data  
  
****plan for next month****  
Test and Revise  
Collect and Analyze data
