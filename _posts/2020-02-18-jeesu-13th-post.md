Introduce our friend!  
  
Actually, we don't know him very much.:)  
His name is Addison C Farinas. he is undergraduate student of university of science.  
He likes snowing and cold weather. He said he likes 'bad weather'.  
Because he lives in Indiana a most time of life.  

He is really kind and gentle. He gives us a lot of help for presenting and searching document with English.  
And he is also good at building some ideas, so when we make our tool, he gave us great idea.   
    
He always yield our schedule first.  
So, I always thank him.
