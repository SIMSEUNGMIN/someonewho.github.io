Mentor said that she is upset because of my absent without comment.  
But actually, she never answered to my comment and she never asked me about comment.  
Furthermore, I cannot understand why that is the reasonable reason for throwing chair and yelling me.  
In my standard, that couldn't be happened. Also saying about going Korea and certification is threaten for me. But actually, she doesn't have right.  
  
I can't understand why she said I have to apologize to her. Then, how about my insult from her words saying in front of about 40 people?
