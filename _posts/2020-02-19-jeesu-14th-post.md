I was late because of the hospital promise.  
And, I realized my chair is gone. I was really upset because it happened several times.  
She used that chair at 3D design room, and Suengmin asked her about the chair. I don't know about what do they talked. she came to me and said she is upset because of me.  
Even if she looked that I cleaned up other person's chair for using.  
I was really suprized and feel really shame. I said to her return me after using, but she almost yelled me "I hope that too!".  
I can't know about why she is upset so much.  
She threaten me about the cerification about late and absent about these days, but it is reported, except one day I can't get up from the bed because of headache.  
   
She also throw the chair beside me and screamed "Take it back!". Prof.Eric care about that, but I feel really shame, and I think she is rude to me.  

I never said to her "give me right now!" and also I never raised my voice.  
And, I didn't know about who was using my chair, and what he or she doing with that damn chair.  
She was really overreacting about this asking, and I am really upset.  

Furthermore, one Purdue student next to our team almost can't have a seat because we are lack of chair.  

if someone ask something, I have to think and respect about the asking and even if it is not understandable, I think about why. because it is more productive way of thinking.  
  
if she can't think about that two step, how can she make some helpful thing for our society?  
I don't think that is not good for anyone.
